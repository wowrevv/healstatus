Change the pixel reader/writer: make it completely binary on each sub pixel

[1] - needs read pixel
[2] - 2 ^ 6 = 64
  Selection,
    0 - Nothing, ignore
    1 - Player
    2-5 - Party
    6-46 - Raid

    47 - points on the ground

[2] - 2 ^ 6 = 64
  Abilities
    Just as before but simpler

So we can reduce the pixel count down to 5, and have an entry pixel to read.
